# Vidgrid Transcript Converter

This program translates `.vtt` transcripts from Franciscan's VidGrid / Blackboard lectures into normal paragraph text. That way, it's easier to take notes on it and re-read the lectures.

This will probably also work with other `.vtt` files from other colleges and software, but this has yet to be tested.
